1.  Introduction 
	- The study explores the relationship between social media output and NFL games 
	- Researchers use a dataset containing messages from Twitter and NFL game statistics 
	- Predictive models are built for future game outcomes and sports betting outcomes 
2. Related Work 
	- Previous studies have used social media data to predict election outcomes, stock prices, and more 
	- Some studies have explored the relationship between Twitter data and sports outcomes
3. Data Collection 
	- Researchers collected tweets containing team names or hashtags related to NFL games during the 2012 season 
	- They also collected game statistics from various sources 
4. Data Analysis 
	- Researchers measured their ability to classify a postgame tweet as following a win or loss by its assigned team 
	- They used a classifier with words as features and built domain-specific sentiment lexicons
5. Predictive Models for Game Outcomes 
	- Researchers built models using various feature sets, including Twitter data, game statistics, and a combination of both 
	- Simple features of Twitter data were found to match or exceed the performance of game statistical features 
6. Predictive Models for Betting Outcomes 
	- Researchers built models to predict betting outcomes such as which team will win with the point spread or if total points will be over/under the line
	- They found that combining Twitter data with game statistics improved model performance
7. Conclusion and Future Work 
	- The study provides a dataset for academic research on predicting NFL outcomes using social media data 
	- The approach and dataset may be useful for those who want to use social media to study markets in sports betting and beyond
