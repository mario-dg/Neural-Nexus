## Framework Description
![[Framework.png]]
#### 1. Risk Identification:
- **TOE/Use Case Analysis:** Target of Evaluation (TOE) or use cases must be thoroughly analyzed to understand what needs to be protected.
- **Asset Identification:** This involves identifying all the assets that could be affected by cybersecurity threats.
- **Asset Category:** Assets are categorized to manage them efficiently and apply appropriate security measures.
- **Data Flow Diagram:** Creating a visual representation of the data flow to identify where data moves and can be potentially compromised.
- **Threat Identification using STRIDE Model:** STRIDE is a model used to identify security threats by focusing on Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
- **Threat Scenario:** Developing scenarios in which these threats could be realized helps in understanding the potential impact and required defenses.
#### 2. Risk Analysis:
- **Impact Assessment:** This includes evaluating the impact of a threat materialization on safety, financial aspects, operations, privacy, and legislation.
- **Attack Analysis:**
	- **Attack Path Analysis:** Identifying possible paths an attacker could take.
	- **Attack Tree:** A branching diagram showing the possible routes an attack could take.
	- **Attack Feasibility Assessment:** Determining how likely an attack is to occur.
	- **Attack Potential:** Assessing the potential of an attacker successfully exploiting a vulnerability.
	- **Attack Vector:** The path or means by which an attacker can gain access to a computer or network server in order to deliver a payload or malicious outcome.
	- **CVSS Exploitability:** Referring to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System to gauge the ease and impact of an attack.
#### 3. Risk Assessment:
- **Risk Value:** The quantification of risk, possibly using an empirical equation.
- **Risk Matrix:** A matrix used to define the level of risk by considering the consequence and likelihood of a potential event.
- **Global Rating Algorithm:** An algorithm that takes various factors into account to provide a global risk rating.
- **Risk Level:** The final determination of risk level, which could be low, medium, or high based on the aggregated data.

## General Paper Summary
The paper presents a systematic risk assessment framework for automotive cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for comprehensive analysis throughout the vehicle's lifecycle due to evolving cyber threats. Key components include:

- **Introduction to Automotive Cybersecurity Challenges**: Recognizes the complexity and connectivity of modern vehicles, increasing vulnerability to cyber-attacks, and the importance of cybersecurity risk assessments.
- **Survey on Existing Risk Assessment Methods**: Discusses methods like STRIDE, CVSS, OWASP, and their application in automotive security, highlighting the gaps in current approaches.
- **Systematic Risk Assessment Framework**: Proposes a new framework consisting of risk identification, analysis, and assessment phases, leveraging STRIDE and attack trees for detailed threat evaluation and introducing a novel automotive cybersecurity risk matrix for quantifying risks.
- **Application of the Framework**: Demonstrates the framework's effectiveness through a case study on a Telematics Box (T-Box), showcasing how the proposed method systematically addresses cybersecurity threats.
- **Conclusion**: Affirms the framework's utility in identifying, analyzing, and assessing cybersecurity risks across the vehicle lifecycle, providing a foundation for future research and enhancement of automotive cybersecurity measures.

This framework incorporates specific processes and methods to effectively analyze potential attack paths, integrating changes in threat environments and available information, thereby offering a comprehensive approach to automotive cybersecurity risk assessment.
