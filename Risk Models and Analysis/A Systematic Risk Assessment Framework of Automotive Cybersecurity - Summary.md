![[Framework.png]]1. **Risk Identification:**
    - **TOE/Use Case Analysis:** Target of Evaluation (TOE) or use cases must be thoroughly analyzed to understand what needs to be protected.
    - **Asset Identification:** This involves identifying all the assets that could be affected by cybersecurity threats.
    - **Asset Category:** Assets are categorized to manage them efficiently and apply appropriate security measures.
    - **Data Flow Diagram:** Creating a visual representation of the data flow to identify where data moves and can be potentially compromised.
    - **Threat Identification using STRIDE Model:** STRIDE is a model used to identify security threats by focusing on Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
    - **Threat Scenario:** Developing scenarios in which these threats could be realized helps in understanding the potential impact and required defenses.
    1. **Risk Analysis:**
    - **Impact Assessment:** This includes evaluating the impact of a threat materialization on safety, financial aspects, operations, privacy, and legislation.
    - **Attack Analysis:**
        - **Attack Path Analysis:** Identifying possible paths an attacker could take.
        - **Attack Tree:** A branching diagram showing the possible routes an attack could take.
        - **Attack Feasibility Assessment:** Determining how likely an attack is to occur.
        - **Attack Potential:** Assessing the potential of an attacker successfully exploiting a vulnerability.
        - **Attack Vector:** The path or means by which an attacker can gain access to a computer or network server in order to deliver a payload or malicious outcome.
        - **CVSS Exploitability:** Referring to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System to gauge the ease and impact of an attack.
3. **Risk Assessment:**
    
    - **Risk Value:** The quantification of risk, possibly using an empirical equation.
    - **Risk Matrix:** A matrix used to define the level of risk by considering the consequence and likelihood of a potential event.
    - **Global Rating Algorithm:** An algorithm that takes various factors into account to provide a global risk rating.
    - **Risk Level:** The final determination of risk level, which could be low, medium, or high based on the aggregated data.
