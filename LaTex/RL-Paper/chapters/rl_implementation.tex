\subsection{Unity ML-Agents}\label{subsec:unity-ml-agents}
The Unity ML-Agents Toolkit is an open-source plugin for the Unity game engine.
It bundles easy to use functionality for environment creation, agent training, state-of-the-art RL algorithms and metric logging
all via the given Python API and Unity's editor interface~\cite{juliani2020}.
When working with this package there are only three main entities working together to build the training pipeline: Sensors, Agents and the Academy.
The Agent is the main component, it indicates that a game object serves as a trainable agent in the environment.
It can collect observations via different types of Sensors, take actions chosen by the policy and collect rewards to further improve its performance.
Possible types of observations are vectors of any length and any numerical datatype, images or ray-cast results.
The available RayPerceptionSensor casts rays from a specified point in any direction with an arbitrary length to determine distances to nearby game objects.
And lastly the Academy serves as the connection point, as it manages the simulation, its global steps and the agents in the environment.
