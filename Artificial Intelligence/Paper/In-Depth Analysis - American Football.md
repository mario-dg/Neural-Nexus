Machine learning has been increasingly used in American Football data analysis to predict player performance, game outcomes, and injury risks. In this context, various models and techniques have been proposed to analyze different aspects of the game.

One study focused on predicting wide receiver trajectories in American Football using a computational model that combines prior knowledge about the game and short-term predictive models of how the environment will change over time[1]. The model used a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a reward function that is a linear combination of static features (prior knowledge about the game) and dynamic features (short-term prediction of opponent players) [1].

Another research paper analyzed Dutch football (soccer) match prediction using machine learning classifiers, such as random tree models, Na√Øve Bayes models, and k-nearest neighbor models[2]. Although this study focused on soccer, the techniques used could potentially be applied to American Football as well.

In a more recent study, a novel metric called STRAIN was proposed for evaluating pass rushers in the National Football League (NFL) using player tracking data[3]. STRAIN measures defensive pressure in football based on the distance between the pass rusher and the quarterback (QB) and the rate at which this distance is being reduced[3].

In the context of injury risk, a study used machine learning algorithms to identify injury risks in elite-level youth soccer players based on anthropometric and motor performance measures[4]. Although this study focused on soccer, the approach could be adapted to American Football to better understand injury risks in the sport.

In summary, machine learning techniques have been applied to various aspects of American Football data analysis, including predicting player trajectories, game outcomes, and injury risks. These techniques have the potential to provide valuable insights and improve decision-making in the sport.
