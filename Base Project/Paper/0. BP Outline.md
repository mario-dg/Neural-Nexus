## Outline for "Generation of Synthetic Brightfield Microscopy Images Using Unconditional Diffusion Models"

### I. Introduction
- Introduce DDPM and DDIM shortly
- Unconditional Image Generation, why and how it differs to conditional or typical Diffusion Task (Stable Diffusion)
- Why generate Brightfield Microscopy Images, time money and work
- Downstream goal of this (cell detection model)
- Summary of applied techniques (DDIM and DDPM)
### II. Related Work
- GANs, VAE and normalizing flow
- Generally a pretty new field of research
### III. Unconditional Image Diffusion
- Describe what Unconditional Image Diffusion is, show some formulas
### IV. Experiments
- Dataset description
- Image Pre-processing, 512x512, labelling
- Model training, huggingface accelerate and diffusers, Tested DDPM and DDIM with varying inference steps, num epochs, augmentation techniques, RGB and Greyscale, (no) normalization for varying brightnesses, problems on image edges -> loss only on smaller part of image, FID problematic due to having greyscale images, DDIM needed many inference steps to work adequately, A100 with 40GB, time varied from 15h to 42h
- post-processing, model output seemed to be inverted
### V. Results
- metric based evaluation difficult, e.g. FID as mentioned above,
- mostly manual evaluation with experts and non-experts
- best performing model/configuration
### VI. Discussion and Conclusion
- summarize purpose of this study
- summarize findings and methodolgy of this study
