- **Software Entropy:** Complexity increases with codebase growth, making organization and structure difficult to maintain.
- **Challenges with MVC Architecture:** Lack of clear rules for maintaining responsibility boundaries, leading to logic leakage between components.
- **Communication and Requirements Gathering:** Iterative process prone to misinterpretation, risking project deviation from original goals.
- **Naming Challenges:** Importance of clear, appropriate naming to bridge understanding between developers and business stakeholders.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Approach to address technical and non-technical project challenges, focusing on the business problem and organizing logic accordingly. Introduced by Eric Evans.
- **Strategic Design:** Involves splitting the design into Bounded Contexts to manage complexity and maintain control over the system.
    - **Bounded Context:** Conceptual boundary grouping related components to avoid ambiguity.
    - **Context Mapping:** Visual documentation of Bounded Contexts, showing relationships and communications between them.
- **Collaborative Modeling:** Involves close collaboration between developers and domain experts to refine the Domain Model using a Ubiquitous Language that merges business and technical jargon.
- **Tactical Design:** Includes patterns and constructs like Entities, Value Objects, Services, Aggregates, Factories, and Repositories to detail domain logic.
    - **Entities:** Objects with a unique identity.
    - **Value Objects:** Describe characteristics without unique identity; should be immutable.
    - **Services:** Stateless operations not directly related to Entities or Value Objects.
    - **Aggregates:** Collections of Entities and Value Objects with a transactional boundary, managed by an Aggregate Root.
    - **Factories:** Encapsulate the creation of complex objects or aggregates.
    - **Repositories:** Interface for retrieving stored objects, abstracting away the infrastructure specifics.
- **Isolating the Domain from Other Concerns:** Emphasizes separating domain logic from other functionalities using a Layered Architecture (User Interface, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure) to reduce complexity and improve clarity.
- **Conclusion:** DDD is a holistic approach aimed at solving business problems through collaboration and strict design patterns, beneficial when properly applied but not a universal solution.
