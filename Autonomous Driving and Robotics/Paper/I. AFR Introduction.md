Content:
- A survey of existing lane detection methods, including traditional methods based on hand-crafted features and deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- A new lane detection method that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence decoder to generate lane curves.
- A comprehensive evaluation of different lane detection methods on four public datasets (CULane, TuSimple, BDD100K and ApolloScape) and two self-collected datasets (ComplexLane and NightLane) under various scenarios (daytime/nighttime, urban/rural/highway, straight/curved lanes).
