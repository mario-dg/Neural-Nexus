| Scoring System | Description | Parameters | Purpose | Application |
|----------------|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| REMS (Rapid Emergency Medicine Score) | Prognosis-related system for identifying critical patients and predicting mortality. | Vital signs, oxygen saturation, age, and level of consciousness | Identify critical patients and predict mortality | Emergency rooms |
| RAPS (Rapid Acute Physiology Score) | Triage system similar to REMS for predicting patient outcomes. | Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness | Predict patient outcomes and assist in triage | Emergency rooms |
| MPM II_0 (Mortality Probability Model) | Intensive care scoring system for predicting short-term and long-term mortality. | Physiological variables, age, and comorbidities | Predict short-term and long-term mortality | Intensive care units and emergency rooms |
| KTAS (Korean Triage Acuity Scale) | Mandatory scoring system in South Korea with potential for machine learning-based triage. | Vital signs, symptoms, and medical history | Assign patients to care levels and assist in triage | Emergency rooms in South Korea |

The table has been updated with shortened descriptions and purposes for each scoring system, providing a concise overview of their main characteristics and applications.
