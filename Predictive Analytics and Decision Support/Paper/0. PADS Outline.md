# Bridging the Gap: Integrating Explainable AI into Decision Support for Emergency Room Triage

## 1. Introduction
- Briefly introduce the concept of XAI and its importance in healthcare
- Explain the role of triage in emergency rooms and the challenges faced by healthcare professionals
- Present the research question: How can XAI be applied to improve triage decision-making in emergency rooms?
- Classification of patients based on their conditions into Emergency Severity Index (ESI) for prioritization
- Automation of diagnostic tests in the triage stage

## 2. Background and Related Work
- Review the current state of XAI research and its applications in healthcare
- Discuss existing methods for triage decision-making in emergency rooms (e.g., manual assessment, scoring systems, etc.)
- Summarize previous studies that have applied machine learning or AI techniques to triage
